    <h1>Steve H</h1>
    I've got a lot of self-taught experience with web development, but I wanted to take it a step further and get formally educated in 
    the subject.  Aside from web development, I've taken Algorithms, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, 
    and Machine Learning.  Languages that I know include C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

    My top favorite foods includes the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Baby Back Ribs</li>
        <li>King Crab Legs</li>
        <li>Pizza - of course!</li>
    </ol>
