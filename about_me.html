    <p style="font-size: larger;"><i>A few sentences about a trip or getaway that you took in the past few years:</i></p>
    <p>Over a decade ago, I traveled to Tanzania and summited Mt. Kilimanjaro, the roof of Africa.  It was week-long adventure 
        and I saw the most amazing flora and fauna.  The actual climb up the mountain took me five days and the air got so thin 
        that I actually developed mountain sickness causing me to skip my malaria medication in the process.  As a result, 
        when I returned to my hotel in Moshi, I developed malaria and had to travel to a remote village to see a 
        doctor.  Fun albeit scary times.

    <a href="https://ayawaskasf.com" target="_blank">Ayawaska</a>
    <p>The above link is to a restaurant called Ayawaska.  It's a Peruvian restaraunt in my home town here in Novato, California,
        but that's not why I like it.  I like it because it sits on one of the highest point in Novato and we get a good
        look at the rest of the town from there.  They also have really great cocktails.

    I think in another life I was a Southerner because I tend to really like Southern BBQ.  When I make baby back ribs
    I use a pressure cooker to create that falling off the bone tenderness and then throw on the grill for that smokey
    taste.

            <td>Until around 11,000 BC, all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide 
                occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, 
                farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by
                prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start 
                in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, 
                and genocide.

                but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. 
                This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping 
                point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and 
                disseminating ideas.
